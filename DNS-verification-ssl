Installing Certbot on Nginx server
1.sudo add-apt-repository ppa:certbot/certbot
2.sudo apt-get update
3.sudo apt-get install certbot

Running Certbot

sudo ufw allow 443

sudo certbot certonly --manual --preferred-challenge dns -d nginx.explorersight.com
(after this gives you DNS TXT record name and Its Value  put this name and value on the domain host website where you register domain name)

For example :
Saving debug log to /var/log/letsencrypt/letsencrypt.log
Requesting a certificate for nginx.explorersight.com

Please deploy a DNS TXT record under the name:

_acme-challenge.example.com.

with the following value:

e6HshD-ncwcgJK6pcnYEwmW7cvsdcwTi7S_Qkxb14lIWgQsdhcb 

Before continuing, verify the TXT record has been deployed. Depending on the DNS
provider, this may take some time, from a few seconds to multiple minutes. You can
check if it has finished deploying with aid of online tools, such as the Google
Admin Toolbox: https://toolbox.googleapps.com/apps/dig/#TXT/_acme-challenge.nginx.explorersight.com.
Look for one or more bolded line(s) below the line ';ANSWER'. It should show the
value(s) you've just added.

Successfully received certificate.
Certificate is saved at: /etc/letsencrypt/live/example.com/fullchain.pem
Key is saved at:         /etc/letsencrypt/live/example.com/privkey.pem
This certificate expires on yyyy-mm-dd.
These files will be updated when the certificate renews.
Next step:
- This certificate will not be renewed automatically. Autorenewal of --manual certificates requires the use of an authentication hook script (--manual-auth-hook) but one was not provided. To renew this certificate, repeat this same certbot command before the certificate's expiry date.
